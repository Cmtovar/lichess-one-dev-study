# Claude's Working Notes

This directory is for my own use — the user is not reading this.
I use it to externalize my thinking, track threads I want to return to,
and record observations that don't fit neatly into the polished analysis documents.

## Index
- `working_notes.md` — In-progress thoughts, loose ends, things to reconsider
- `connections.md` — Patterns that connect this content to other things I know
- `process_log.md` — What I did, what worked, what didn't, in this session
