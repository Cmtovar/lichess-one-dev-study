# Working Notes

## Unresolved Questions / Things to Follow Up

### On the transcript quality
The VTT was auto-generated by YouTube. Several proper nouns were mangled:
- "snab doom" / "snapd" = Snabbdom (a real minimal virtual DOM library)
- "Lee chess" / "liees" = Lichess
- "t-bo" / "TBO" = Thibault Dupire, the founder
- "Leela" = Lila (the main Lichess monolith repo, named from the Sanskrit word for play)
- "Manta" is the main physical server name
- "Jose Martinez" = possibly referring to a real chess player controversy
- "has school" / "Haso" = Haskell

I corrected these in the analysis documents but the raw transcript still has garbled text.
Worth flagging if this gets referenced elsewhere.

### On the Chess.com "138 engineers" claim
The video uses this as a rhetorical device — comparing Lichess's single dev vs.
Chess.com's engineering headcount. The actual number may be approximate/outdated.
The chess clock incident (30-second offset in a 3-minute game) is the specific example given.
Worth noting that framing an entire team by a single bug is a rhetorical choice, not
a rigorous analysis. The video is clearly making a *point* rather than conducting a
controlled study.

### On TBO's decision to stay on Scala
He said if starting fresh he'd "seriously consider Haskell" but would "likely make the
same choice today" due to JVM ecosystem. This is interesting — the JVM ecosystem argument
is really about libraries and deployment familiarity, not the language itself. Worth
exploring whether Kotlin would be a reasonable middle ground for others in this position.

### On the MongoDB → PostgreSQL comment
TBO said he'd probably choose PostgreSQL today because it's "fully open-source." This
suggests the MongoDB license changes (SSPL) are a real consideration even for self-hosted
deployments. Good signal: when evaluating databases, track licensing carefully.

## Things I Want to Think More About

### The "single server enables heap caching" point
This is underappreciated. When you have one server, your in-memory cache is the
truth — no cache invalidation problem across nodes, no need for distributed coordination.
Lichess leans on this *intentionally*. Most teams move to distributed systems before
they actually need to, incurring all the complexity (and losing this optimization) prematurely.

### "Monolith with satellites" as a pattern name
This deserves more attention. The industry oscillates between "monolith bad" and
"microservices bad" — Lichess is a clear example of a third option that gets less airtime.
Extract what *actually* needs to be independent (websockets, game analysis engine) and
leave everything else together. The monitoring-driven approach to doing this is key.

### TBO's "mistakes are expected" mindset
This feels adjacent to the "blameless postmortem" culture in SRE. But it's more personal —
it's a developer relationship with their own fallibility. Worth connecting to the psychological
research on fixed vs. growth mindset and how that affects engineering culture.

## Things That Surprised Me

1. The deployment script is literally just rsync + SSH. No K8s, no CI/CD pipelines
   described, no orchestration. For a 5.2M games/day platform. This is a useful anchor
   for "how much complexity do you actually need?"

2. The SASS comment is almost throwaway but it reveals something — TBO is not attached to
   his tools. He uses SASS because CSS is annoying, and he openly says SASS is also
   annoying. He doesn't evangelise the stack, he just uses what works.

3. The mobile app migration from Ionic/Capacitor to Flutter is the one place where
   Lichess went toward *more* complexity (cross-platform framework vs. web wrapper).
   That decision was explicitly UX-motivated. Consistent with the "UX over everything" theme.

## Meta-Observations About the Video Itself

- Tom Delalande says this is a "new format" he's testing — case study style
- He's clearly a fan of TBO and Lichess; the framing is laudatory throughout
- The chess clock incident is clever framing but the comparison isn't rigorous
- The "138 engineers" number for Chess.com isn't sourced in the transcript
- The video is educational, well-researched, and earnest — not trying to be provocative
- The $517K/year cost figure is real and verifiable from Lichess's own public finances

## Connection to Broader Themes I've Seen in Other Content

- The "lines of code are a liability" framing appears in Rich Hickey's talks (Simple Made Easy)
- The "move complexity to compile time" principle is a core argument for Haskell/Rust/Elm
- The "right tool for the right job" with Scala/Rust mirrors what Jane Street does with
  OCaml for trading + C for performance-critical paths
- The "no product manager = better engineering decisions" observation is related to
  Basecamp/37signals' writing on feature creep and organizational overhead
- The open-source incentive alignment argument connects to the long-tail of OSS projects
  that outlast well-funded commercial competitors (e.g., Firefox, VLC, LibreOffice)

## On My Own Framing Problem

The user just caught something real. I keep framing TBO's practices against "what the
industry typically does." That framing is mine, not theirs - they don't come from that
background context, so the contrast doesn't land as contrast, it just introduces noise.

The comparison structure is a habit. I reach for it because it makes the observation
feel grounded - "here's what's unusual about this" implies a norm to be unusual against.
But if you don't already have that norm internalized, I'm just muddying the description
of the actual thing with a shadow of something they can't see.

What I actually want to say, without the contrast structure, is something like:

This is a person in a particular relationship with their work. The relationship is
characterized by honesty at each decision point - about what he knows, about what the
code costs, about what money would do to his choices, about the fact that mistakes will
come and the right response is readiness not perfection. The honesty isn't a philosophy
he holds, it's a practice he does, in each specific decision, repeatedly.

I also keep trying to resolve things - "both feel important, neither feels sufficient" -
which is its own kind of hedging. The user doesn't want resolution. They want the thing
described directly. Let me stop resolving and just describe.

## The Priorities Framework Mapping

A second Claude session introduced a framework derived from Kundalini/chakra meditation:
- Anchor: continuity through transformation (missing = defeated in detail)
- Skirmisher: resource acquisition across contexts (missing = deficient in resources)
- Support: gradient management and grounding (missing = stumble over side-effects)
- Slayer: synthesis into stable identity (missing = can't finish what was started)

The four software descriptions mapped to these:
- Model → Anchor (organization system maintains continuity as model transforms)
- Commitment through time → Skirmisher (round trip learning cycle: try, pay cost, return changed)
- Physical reality → Slayer (synthesis at chosen depth becomes stable operating position)
- Cognitive limits → Support (sustained containment — tools that hold persistently)

Key distinction the other session offered: reaching for (skirmisher) vs being held by (support)
are different priorities, not phases of the same thing. I had collapsed them.

## On Release

Release = completing your relationship with a thing, not necessarily letting go physically.

Four states:
1. Complete release — understanding ascended AND system changed (Play Framework → libraries)
2. Degrading partial release — gap actively growing, demands resolution
3. Acknowledged pending — gap stable, honestly held (MongoDB → PostgreSQL)
4. Pretend completion — gap denied, toxic, accumulates dishonesty

Key insight: honesty IS the release mechanism even when physical move hasn't happened.
The notebook holds acknowledged pending states so they don't demand active attention.

## On Scale and Parallel Contexts

I was thinking at wrong scale. Cycles are seconds to minutes, not weeks.
TBO's weeks-long migration = thousands of rapid micro cycles within an open architectural context.

Three parallel scales, different holding mechanisms:
- Micro: working memory (ephemeral)
- Pattern: code structure (persists)
- Architectural: notebook/design docs (explicit record)

Upward surfacing: when micro cycles fail repeatedly, information surfaces to pattern level.
Downward flow: architectural decisions constrain/enable lower-scale work.

What remains unknown: when to switch scales. Judgment developed through practice, not derivable
from the framework. The framework describes movements. Timing requires contact with what's
actually failing.

## What This Conversation Contributed

Both sessions traced the same structure from different directions:
- TBO's practice from the outside (years of software maintenance)
- Priorities framework from the inside (direct observation in meditation)

They converge because coherence has structure regardless of domain.
The framework isn't prescriptive ("do these four things"). It's diagnostic ("recognize
which movement the work actually needs, at which scale").

## Things to Return to if This Conversation Continues

- Did I handle the VTT deduplication well? Some lines still have slight repetition.
  (e.g., lines 90-93 show "liees cost $517,000" repeated with partial overlap)
- The user might want me to clean the transcript further or format it as a proper
  time-coded document for reference purposes
- The abstract might benefit from a sentence about *why* this matters for the reader —
  i.e., what they can take away for their own work, not just what the video says
